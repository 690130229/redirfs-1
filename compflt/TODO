- implement constat-size compressed blocks (cblock.c)
- implement i_post_unlink (delete fheader from cache)
- implement f_pre_llseek (compensate for wrong inode->i_size)
- make it thread/smp safe
- optimize writes that overwrite whole existing blocks (no need to read them)
- better return value / error handling
- support for dynamic changing of COMPFLT_BLOCK_SIZE_U (dm->size_max?)
- get rid of hard-coded comp_methods list (fill from cryptoapi)
- stat/fstat/... (struct stat).st_size
- support already existig non-compressed files in write operations ?
- optimize writes to the last block(not-full) by holding it in memory ?
  (== better performance on sequential writes with COMPFLT_BLOCK_SIZE_U > 4096)

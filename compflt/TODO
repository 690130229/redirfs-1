high:
- implement f_pre_llseek (compensate for wrong inode->i_size)
- make it thread/smp safe
- (struct file).all is only for statistics now ...

medium:
- optimize writes that overwrite whole existing blocks (no need to read them)
- compress_dir utility

low:
- renaming cflt_file to cflt_inode makes more sense (the data is inode-specific)
- consider using configfs for setting methods/block_size/etc.

- port to new RedirFS version
- remove dmap specific things from header_read/header_write
- locking (spin lock + use semaphores on anything that can sleep/take long)
- better return value handling
- add a max_u member to dmap so we can safely change COMPFLT_BLOCK_SIZE between versions
- stat/fstat/... (struct stat).st_size

NOTE: alot of TODOs are marked in the code

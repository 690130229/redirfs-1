\chapter{Prologue}
Filesystem access control is an important part of operating system security. The Linux
kernel provides default filesystem access control based on rights (read, write,
execute) which are divided for owner, group and others. In some cases this is not
enough and access control needs to be extended. As an example, we can consider
on--access scanning by an anti--virus application. The anti--virus application needs to
be notified when other processes are trying to open, execute or close some files. This
is not possible with the standard filesystem access control mechanism. Another example
can be problems with root's rights. By default there are no limitations for root. In
some cases it is desirable to limit the root's rights. For example when some process
need to be executed with root privileges. This is also not possible with the standard
Linux access control mechanism. Several projects like RSBAC, Medusa or LSM provide
enhanced access control frameworks for Linux kernels.
This thesis focuses on filesystem access control, describes the existing possibilities
of filesystem access control, and points out their problems and limitations. Further
it in detail describes the Linux implementation of the Virtual Filesystem Switch (VFS)
and introduces a new Redirfs framework based on it. Redirfs aims to be  a general
framework which allows third party modules to be notified about VFS events. Redirfs
tries to overcome the problems and limitations of existing solutions. This thesis uses
filesystem access control analysis from semestral project.

	\item [Chapter 2]
		describes in detail the Virtual Filesystem Switch and its
		implementation in the Linux kernel. It also provides information about
		all objects which form the VFS, and describes their data fields and
		operations. Further it focus on the VFS object interaction and
		interconnection.
		
	\item [Chapter 3]
		presents the Linux Security Module framework which was included in the
		Linux kernel 2.6. It describes its interface, modules stacking, and
		points out its flawed design.

	\item [Chapter 4]
		describes overlay filesystems and the way they are implemented for the
		Linux kernels. It presents the FiST project which provides overlay
		filesystem generator.

	\item [Chapter 5]
		presents Dazuko which is aimed to be a cross-platform device driver
		that allows applications to control file access on a system. It
		describes several ways in which the Dazuko interacts with the Linux
		kernel.

	\item [Chapter 6]
		introduces the Redirfs framework which creates a new layer between the
		VFS layer and the native filesystems. It replaces the VFS object's
		operations and allows third-party modules to be notified about VFS
		events. It describes its design, architecture, implementation, and
		interface.

	\item [Chapter 7] 
		contains sample code of the dummyflt which uses the Redirfs framework.

	\item [Chapter 8] 
		describes implementation of the avgflt. This is a filter using the
		Redirfs framework, which communicates with the AVG7 Anti-Virus daemon
		and provides on-access scanning.

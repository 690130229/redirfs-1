\chapter{The Virtual Filesystem Switch}
The Virtual Filesystem Switch, or VFS was first introduced by Sun Microsystems
in 1986 and implemented in the SunOS. Since then all other Unix based
operating systems have adopted the VFS concept. The VFS provides an abstract software layer
that allows the operating system kernel to call functions of different filesystems
without having to know anything about the specific filesystem type. The following
text will describe VFS implementation in the Linux kernel, with a view to the last
Linux kernel version 2.6.11.3 available at the time of writing this thesis. 

In the beginning the Linux kernel only supported the Minix filesystem. However its design
restrictions were too limiting, so it was necessary to implement a new filesystem,
which was then called Extended File System (ExtFS). The new ExtFS had to coexist with
Minix and that was why the first VFS implementation was included in the Linux kernel.
Initially, implementation of the Linux VFS was written by Chris Provenzano. It
was later
rewritten by Linus Torvalds and included along with the ExtFS into the Linux kernel
0.96c in April 1992. Thanks to the VFS a lot of other filesystems were written or
ported and included in the Linux kernel, which now, in comparison with
other Unix type systems, supports most filesystems. Filesystems supported by the Linux kernel can
be divided into three groups.

\subsubsection*{Disk-based Filesystems}
These are the base filesystems, which manage data stored on hard drives.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Filesystems written primary for Linux such as Second Extended Filesystem
		(Ext2), Third Extended File System (Ext3) and the Reiser Filesystem
		(ReiserFS).
	\item Filesystems for other Unix type systems such as SYSV filesystem
		(System V, Coherent, XENIX), UFS (BSD, Solaris, Next) and VERITAS VxFS
		(SCO UnixWare).
	\item ISO9660 CD-ROM Filesystem and Universal Disk Format (UDF) DVD file
		system.
	\item Other proprietary Filesystems such as HPFS (IBM's OS/2), HFS (Apple's
		Macintosh), Amiga's Fast Filesystem (AFFS) and Acorn Disk Filing
		System (ADFS).
	\item Other journaling filesystems originating in systems other than Linux
		such as JFS (IBM) and XFS (SGI).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Network Filesystems}
These filesystems allows access to other filesystems located on other computer's hard
drives via the network. The most known are NFS, Coda, Andrew Filesystem (AFS), Server
Message Block (SMB) and Novell's NetWare Core Protocol (NCP).

\subsubsection*{Special Filesystems}
These filesystems are not stored on hard drives, but are created dynamically. Typical
examples are /proc filesystem or /sys filesystem.

\section{VFS Role}

\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
		\input{pic_vfs_role.pstex_t}
	\end{center}
	\caption{The VFS role during system calls}
	\label{fig:vfs_role}
\end{figure}

The VFS provides a universal method for accessing different filesystems. It consist of
several objects, which will be described in detail later in this chapter. The file
system driver has to be able to convert physical representation of the filesystem
stored on disk into VFS objects and vice versa. This concept warrants a uniform
interface for all filesystems as is shown in figure \ref{fig:vfs_role}.

All system calls relating to the filesystems are directed to the VFS. All processes
in the user space use the same interface for all filesystems as is shown in figure
\ref{fig:vfs_role}. The differences between specific filesystems are handled by the VFS.
In fact the VFS hides all specific filesystems and presents them to the user space
processes as one.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
		\input{pic_vfs_copy.pstex_t}
	\end{center}
	\caption{The VFS role in a simple copy file operation}
	\label{fig:vfs_copy}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:vfs_copy} shows a simple copy file operation. We will consider the
following command, which copies the \texttt{test} file from \texttt{/mnt/hda6} to
the \texttt{/mnt/hda7} directory. \\

\texttt{\$ cp /mnt/hda6/test /mnt/hda7/test\\}

It is obvious, that the \texttt{cp} command doesn't know about the filesystem
mounted on \texttt{/mnt/hda6} or \texttt{/mnt/hda7} directory. Read, write and other
operations used by cp command are handled by the VFS and directed to the specific file
system.

\section{VFS Data Structures}
\label{lab:data_struct}
The previous section has shown the VFS role. This section will describe in detail all
objects forming the Linux VFS and their main data fields with focus on the interaction
between the VFS objects.

The VFS design is object oriented, even if it is written in pure C code. The main objects
are super block, inode, dentry and file. All these objects are represented by
structure, which aside from data fields contains a pointer to the structure with
pointers to the functions. This structure of pointers is filled by the filesystem
driver, so that every object created contains pointers to the functions of the
specific filesystem. That is how the VFS knows, which specific filesystem functions
to call in the simple copy example in figure \ref{fig:vfs_copy}.

All file paths mentioned in the following text are relative to the root directory
of the Linux source tree. 

\subsection{Linux Kernel Linked Lists}
For the following text, which will describe the VFS data structures, it is important to
understand how Linux kernel linked lists work.

The Linux kernel uses a lot of linked lists (hundreds), so it would be a big waste to
create new structures for each list and implement new operations (add, delete,
initialization etc.). Linux kernel defines two generic linked lists to prevent
this waste. Both lists are double linked and defined in 
\texttt{include/linux/list.h}. The first is defined by the structure \texttt{list\_head}
and the second by the structures \texttt{hlist\_head} and \texttt{hlist\_node}.

The list based on the \texttt{list\_head} structure is circular. The second list isn't circular,
has separate list head from list nodes and is primarily used for hash tables. 
We will focus only on lists based on the \texttt{list\_head} structure because the
principles are the same for both. The \texttt{list\_head} structure contains only two
pointers \texttt{next} and \texttt{prev}. Both pointers point again to the
\texttt{list\_head} structure. In figure \ref{fig:vfs_list} you can see an example of how
the aux structure is linked. The usage is very simple, all that has to be done is to
add a \texttt{list\_head} field to the structure and then use functions and macros for
list manipulation, which are also defined in \texttt{include/linux/list.h}

\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
		\input{pic_list.pstex_t}
	\end{center}
	\caption{List created by list\_head structures}
	\label{fig:vfs_list}
\end{figure}

The list is linked through the \texttt{list\_head} structure placed in the \texttt{aux}
structure. Now it is time to explain how the pointer to the aux structure is acquired.
The best way will be to describe the \texttt{list\_entry(ptr, type, member)} macro, which
does this. The \texttt{ptr} argument is a pointer to the \texttt{list\_head}
structure inside the \texttt{aux} structure, which in our example is a pointer to the
\texttt{list\_item} variable, \texttt{type} is the name of the structure, which in our example
is \texttt{struct aux}, and \texttt{member} is a name of the \texttt{list\_head}
structure, which in our example is \texttt{list\_item}. Macro \texttt{list\_entry}
counts the address of the \texttt{aux} structure and returns its pointer. 

The base command (expression) in \texttt{list\_entry} is \texttt{\&((type*)0)->member}
defined in \\ \texttt{include/linux/stddef.h}, which returns the offset from
\texttt{member} address to the requested structure start address. Now, when the offset
is known, it is very easy to count the address of \texttt{aux} structure.

 
\subsection{Superblock Object}
The superblock structure \texttt{struct super\_blok} is defined in
\texttt{include/linux/fs.h} and is created for every mounted filesystem. It presents
an entry point to the filesystem. All superblock objects are linked through
\texttt{struct list\_head s\_list} field. List header \texttt{struct list\_head
super\_blocks} is defined in \texttt{fs/super.c}. The superblock contains some metadata
information like block size, maximum size of file, mount flags and others. It is
partially filled by VFS and the rest of the fields have to be filled by a specific file
system driver. The superblock contains the \texttt{struct dentry *s\_root} field, which
represents the root dentry object for the filesystem. The dentry object is described in section
\ref{lab:dentry}. The field \texttt{struct file\_system\_type *s\_type} is a pointer
to the object, which contains information about the filesystem (for example filesystem
name, which is used as a argument to the mount command). The filesystem type object is
described in section \ref{lab:file_system_type}. The field \texttt{struct list\_head
s\_dirty} is the list header of modified inodes. It is used when a filesystem is
unmounted and all dirty inodes have to be flushed to the disk. The field \texttt{struct
list\_head s\_files} is the list header of all file objects opened on the
filesystem. The file
object is described in section \ref{lab:file}. The pointer to superblock operations is
stored in \texttt{struct super\_operations *s\_op} field and has to be filled by the file
system driver. Operations mostly convert VFS's inode to the disk inode and
vice versa (\texttt{read\_inode, write\_inode}).

\subsection{Inode Object}
\label{lab:inode}
All information needed by the VFS about a file are stored in a data structure called
\texttt{struct inode}, defined in \texttt{include/linux/fs.h}. The VFS's inode is
different to the inode stored on disk. The inode in VFS is created by VFS and duplicates
some information from the inode stored on disk to reduce slow access to the hard disk. In
some operating systems (*BSD) the VFS's inodes are called vnodes (virtual inode) to
avoid confusion with inodes stored on disk. In the following text all inode
information relates to the inode in the VFS.

The inode structure can represent a regular file, directory, character device,
block device, fifo, symlink, or unix sockets. The field \texttt{umode\_t i\_mode} is
used to distinguish the file type and also contains access rights to the inode. Every
inode is identified by an inode number stored in the field \texttt{unsigned long i\_ino}
which is unique within the scope of one filesystem. The inode structure doesn't contain
the file name. That is because it can have several file names (hardlinks). The file name is
stored in the dentry object, which will be described in section
\ref{lab:dentry}. The inode
contains a list of all file names (dentries) assigned to it and the head of the list is
stored in \texttt{struct list\_head i\_dentry}. The number of hardlinks pointing to an
inode is in the field \texttt{unsigned int i\_nlink}. The inode can be in several states.
The state is stored in the \texttt{unsigned long i\_state} field and can contain the following
inode state bits. \texttt{I\_DIRTY\_SYNC, I\_DIRTY\_DATASYNC, I\_DIRTY\_PAGES} or
\texttt{I\_DIRTY}, which defines all three previous and indicates that the inode
is dirty and the corresponding disk inode has to be updated. \texttt{I\_FREE} indicates
that the inode is being freed, \texttt{I\_CLEAR} means that the inode content is no longer
meaningful, \texttt{I\_NEW} means that inode is newly created and its data has to be
filled by the specific filesystem and finally \texttt{I\_LOCK} means that the inode is
involved in I/O transfer. Every inode has a usage counter \texttt{atomic\_t i\_count},
which indicates that the inode is used by some process.
Each inode always appears in one of the following lists. List \texttt{struct
list\_head inode\_unused} of valid unused inodes with \texttt{i\_count} set to zero,
defined in \texttt{fs/inode.c}. List \texttt{struct list\_head inode\_in\_use} of
valid in-use inodes with positive \texttt{i\_count} and \texttt{i\_nlink} fields,
defined in \texttt{fs/inode.c} and list of dirty inodes with positive
\texttt{i\_count} and \texttt{i\_nlink} fields, but also with dirty flag set in
\texttt{i\_state} field. The field \texttt{struct list\_head i\_list} is used to link
inode in one of the mentioned lists. Inodes are placed in an inode cache, which reduces
access to the disk. VFS uses a hash table to speed up inode searching. The field
\texttt{struct list\_head i\_hash} is used to link inodes with the same hash value. More
about the inode cache can be found in section \ref{lab:inode_cache}.

The inode contains inode and file operations. The pointer to inode operations is stored in
the \texttt{struct inode\_operations *i\_op} field and the pointer to file operations
is stored in the \texttt{struct file\_operations *i\_fop}. Both operations are defined
in \texttt{include/linux/fs.h}. Note that Linux has seven types of file and every type
has its own operations. It means, that inode operations for regular files will be
different to inode operations for the directory. Also not all operations have to be set.
For example, only a few file operations will be set for the directory. The rest will be set
to NULL, which means that these operations are not supported. VFS implements some
generic operations. For example if the filesystem doesn't have permission operation, VFS
will call a generic permission function.

The following text will describe the main inode and file functions.


\subsection{Inode Operations}
\subsubsection{\texttt{int create(struct inode *dir, struct dentry *dentry, int mode,
\\ struct nameidata *nd)}}

Creates a new disk inode for a regular file. Argument \texttt{dir} is a pointer to the
parent inode, which is an inode representing the directory, \texttt{dentry} is a new dentry
object to which the new inode will be attached, \texttt{mode} contains the inode type
and its access rights (S\_IFREG, S\_IRWXU, etc.), \texttt{nd} is the result from path lookup.

\subsubsection{\texttt{struct dentry *lookup(struct inode *dir,struct dentry
*dentry,\\ struct nameidata *nd)}}

This function is called when the searched dentry (name) object was not found in the dentry
cache. Argument \texttt{dir} is the inode object of parent, \texttt{dentry} is a newly created
dentry object, that has to be filled by a specific filesystem and \texttt{nd} contains
the dentry object which was last found in the dentry cache.

\subsubsection{\texttt{int link(struct dentry *old,struct inode *dir, struct dentry
*new)}}

Creates new hard link that refers to the inode connected to the \texttt{old} dentry.
The name of the new link is in the \texttt{new} dentry and \texttt{dir} is the
directory inode. The hard
link can refer only to the regular file. Hard link and its regular file have to be on the
same filesystem. This is because a new dentry object is only created for the hard
link. The inode object is the same for both, only is incremented the \texttt{i\_nlink} counter.

\subsubsection{\texttt{int unlink(struct inode *inode, struct dentry *dentry)}}

Removes the hard link of the file specified by \texttt{dentry}. The argument
\texttt{inode} is the parent inode.

\subsubsection{\texttt{int symlink(struct inode *dir, struct dentry *dentry, const char
*path)}}

Creates a new symbolic link. The argument \texttt{dir} is the parent inode,
\texttt{dentry} is the newly
created dentry object for the symlink and \texttt{path} is the path where the symlink will
point to. Symlink can be created for every type of file and can point across file
systems. Filesystem driver creates a new disk inode for symlink and saves the path
into it. When the Linux kernel does a path lookup and finds that an actual inode is the symlink, it
reads the path stored in the disk inode and redirects the following path lookup to the new path.

\subsubsection{\texttt{int mkdir(struct inode *dir, struct dentry *dentry, int mode)}}

Creates a new directory inode. The argument \texttt{dir} is the inode of the parent,
\texttt{dentry} is a newly created dentry object with the name for the new directory. Specific
filesystem will create a new directory disk inode and bind it to the dentry object.
The argument \texttt{mode} contains access rights to the new directory.

\subsubsection{\texttt{int rmdir(struct inode *,struct dentry *)}}

Removes the directory specified by \texttt{dentry} object. Argument \texttt{dir} is 
the parent inode.

\subsubsection{\texttt{int mknod(struct inode *dir, struct dentry *dentry, int mode,
dev\_t rdev)}}

Creates a new disk inode for a special file. The argument \texttt{dir} is the parent inode,
\texttt{dentry} is a newly created dentry object to which the new inode for the
special file will be bound, \texttt{mode} contains access rights and file type for the new
inode and \texttt{rdev} is a device's major number.

\subsubsection{\texttt{int rename(struct inode *old\_dir, struct dentry
*old\_dentry,\\ struct inode *new\_dir, struct dentry *new\_dentry)}}

Argument \texttt{old\_dir} is the directory inode from which the file represented
by \texttt{old\_dentry} will be removed, \texttt{new\_dir} is the new directory inode and
\texttt{new\_dentry} contains a new file name.

\subsubsection{\texttt{int readlink(struct dentry *dentry, char \_\_user *buffer,
int buflen)}}

Copies into the memory area specified by \texttt{buffer} the file pathname corresponding
to the symbolic link specified by the \texttt{dentry}.

\subsubsection{\texttt{int follow\_link(struct dentry *dentry, struct nameidata *nd)}}

Translates a symbolic link specified by a \texttt{dentry} object to the \texttt{nd}
structure which is then used for the following path lookup. 

\subsubsection{\texttt{void truncate(struct inode *inode)}}

Modifies the size of the file associated with the \texttt{inode}.


\subsubsection{\texttt{int permission(struct inode *inode, int mask, struct nameidata
*nd)}}

Checks whether the specified access mode defined by \texttt{mask} is allowed for the
inode. The \texttt{mask} argument contains access type (MAY\_EXEC, MAY\_WRITE, etc.)

\subsection{File Operations}

\subsubsection{\texttt{loff\_t llseek(struct file *file, loff\_t offset, int origin)}}

Updates the file position. The \texttt{file} argument is the object that represents the opened
file. The file object is described in section \ref{lab:file}. The argument \texttt{offset} is
the new file position in the file and \texttt{origin} designates from which part of the file
the \texttt{offset} will be set (0 -- the new position is set to the \texttt{offset} value
from file start position, 1 -- the new file position is set to its current location
plus \texttt{offset}, 2 -- the new file position is set to the size of the file plus
\texttt{offset}). 

\subsubsection{\texttt{ssize\_t read(struct file *file, char \_\_user *buf, size\_t
count,\\loff\_t*offset)}}

Reads \texttt{count} bytes from the \texttt{file} starting at position \texttt{offset} to
the \texttt{buffer}.

\subsubsection{\texttt{ssize\_t write(struct file *, const char \_\_user *, size\_t,
loff\_t *)}}

Writes \texttt{count} bytes from the \texttt{buffer} to the \texttt{file} on the
\texttt{offset} position.

\subsubsection{\texttt{int readdir(struct file *dir, void *dirent, filldir\_t filldir)}}

Returns the next directory entry of the \texttt{dir} in \texttt{dirent}. The argument
\texttt{filldir} contains the address of an auxiliary function that extracts the
fields in a directory entry.

\subsubsection{\texttt{unsigned int poll(struct file *file, struct poll\_table\_struct
*table)}}

Checks whether there is activity on the \texttt{file} and goes to sleep until
something happens to it. The argument \texttt{table} contains the type of activity that
happened to the \texttt{file}.

\subsubsection{\texttt{int ioctl(struct inode *inode, struct file *file, unsigned int
cmd,\\unsigned long args)}}

Sends the command \texttt{cmd} with \texttt{args} to an underlying hardware device
specified by \texttt{inode} and \texttt{file}.

\subsubsection{\texttt{int mmap(struct file *file, struct vm\_area\_struct *vma)}}

Performs a memory mapping of the \texttt{file} into a process address space specified
by \texttt{vma}.

\subsubsection{\texttt{int open(struct inode *, struct file *file)}}

VFS calls this function after the \texttt{file} with \texttt{inode} is opened or
created. Most filesystems use the \texttt{generic\_file\_open} function provided by
the VFS. It disallows the opening of large files on 32bit systems the \texttt{O\_LARGEFILE}
wasn't specified.

\subsubsection{\texttt{int flush(struct file *file)}}

Called when a reference to the \texttt{file} is closed. That is when the
\texttt{f\_count} field of the file object is decremented.

\subsubsection{\texttt{int release(struct inode *inode, struct file *file)}}

Called when the last reference to the \texttt{file} object with the \texttt{inode} is
closed. That is when \texttt{f\_count} field is zero.

\subsubsection{\texttt{int fsync(struct file *file, struct dentry *dentry, int datasync)}}

Writes all cached data of the \texttt{file} with \texttt{dentry} to the disk. If
argument \texttt{datasync} is set the cached data will be flushed only if the inode
has set the I\_DIRTY\_DATASYNC flag.

\subsection{Dentry Object}
\label{lab:dentry}
The dentry object is represented by the \texttt{struct dentry} structure, which is defined
in\\ \texttt{include/linux/dcache.h}. Dentries are used for file path
lookup and are common for all specific filesystems. It means that VFS creates
a common layer over all filesystems for file path lookup. Dentries
are only part of the VFS and specific filesystems have no corresponding image of
the
dentry on disk. The dentry object is created for every component of a path name that a
process looks up. For example, we will consider \texttt{/mnt/hda8/file} file path.
The dentry object is created for \texttt{/}, \texttt{mnt}, \texttt{hda8} and \texttt{file}
component. It is obvious, that dentry objects aren't created only for directories, but
also for files (every file type). All dentry objects are linked in an n-ary tree as is
shown in figure \ref{fig:vfs_dentry}. Field \texttt{struct list\_head d\_subdirs}
contains a header of list, which links all entries (subdirectories, files, char devices,
etc.) in the directory. The \texttt{d\_subdirs} is set only if the dentry object
represents the directory because no other file type can have subdirectories or contain
other files. Note that directories in the VFS are considered as files that contain
other subdirectories and files. Entries of directory dentry are linked through
\texttt{struct list\_head d\_child} field. The \texttt{d\_child} name for this field
can be a little confusing, because dentries are linked through \texttt{d\_child} on
the same level. Perhaps sibling would be a better name. Field \texttt{struct dentry*
d\_parent} contains pointer to the dentry parent object. The dentry name is stored in the
\texttt{struct qstr d\_name} field. The structure \texttt{qstr} contains, in addition the dentry
name, also the name length and hash value of the dentry name. The hash value is used
to speed up comparison of dentry names. Dentry also contains a pointer \texttt{struct
inode *d\_inode} to the inode object. As was written in section \ref{lab:inode} the inode
doesn't contains the file name because it can have several filenames. The name is stored
in a dentry object and several dentry objects can point to the same inode object.
Dentry objects pointing to the same inode are linked through the \texttt{struct
list\_head alias} field and list header is stored in the corresponding inode object.
Dentry objects are stored in the dentry cache. The field \texttt{struct hlist\_node
d\_hash} links the dentry object with the same hash value (dentry cache as well as
inode cache is not collision free). Dentry cache is described in section
\ref{lab:dentry_cache}. Field \texttt{d\_count} is the dentry usage counter.

\begin{figure}[hp]
	\begin{center}
		\input{pic_vfs_dentry.pstex_t}
	\end{center}
	\caption{N-ary dentry objects tree}
	\label{fig:vfs_dentry}
\end{figure}

\newpage
The dentry object may be in one of four states.
\begin{description}
	\item[free] -- The dentry object contains no valid information and is not used
		by the VFS. The corresponding memory area is handled by the slab
		allocator (see section \ref{lab:cache}).
	\item[unused] -- The dentry object is not currently used by the kernel. The
		\texttt{d\_count} usage counter of the object is zero, but the
		\texttt{d\_inode} field still points to the associated inode. The
		dentry object contains valid information, but should be discarded if
		necessary in order to reclaim memory.
	\item[in-use] -- The dentry object is currently used by the kernel. The
		\texttt{d\_count} usage counter is positive and the \texttt{d\_inode}
		field points to the associated inode object. The dentry object
		contains valid information and cannot be discarded.
	\item[negative] -- The inode associated with the dentry object doesn't exist
		and the \texttt{d\_inode} field is set to NULL. This could happened if the
		disk inode has been deleted or a non-existing path has been resolved.
\end{description}

All unused dentry objects are linked in the LRU (Last Recently Used) list and can be freed
in order to reclaim memory. The header of the LRU list \texttt{struct list\_head
dentry\_unused} is in \texttt{fs/dcache.c}. The \texttt{int d\_mounted} flag
signalizing that the dentry object is mount point of other filesystem. It is used by
the path look up routine to switch path look up to the other filesystem. The dentry object
contains a pointer \texttt{struct dentry\_operations d\_op} to the dentry operations,
which are described in section \ref{lab:dentry_ops}.
Most filesystems don't fill these operations and keep them empty.

\subsection{Dentry Operations}
\label{lab:dentry_ops}

\subsubsection{\texttt{int d\_revalidate(struct dentry *dentry, struct nameidata *nd)}}

Determines whether the \texttt{dentry} object is still valid. The VFS default
function does nothing, although network filesystems (NFS) may specify their own
function.

\subsubsection{\texttt{int d\_hash(struct dentry *dentry, struct qstr *name)}}

Creates a hash value from \texttt{name} and saves it to the \texttt{dentry} object. This
is used by filesystems that implement their own hash function for the dentry cache.

\subsubsection{\texttt{int d\_compare(struct dentry *dentry, struct qstr *name1,\\struct qstr
*name2)}}

Compares \texttt{name1} and \texttt{name2}. The \texttt{dentry} argument is the parent
dentry. Each filesystem can use its own comparison function. For example Window's file
systems don't distinguish capital from lowercase letters.

\subsubsection{\texttt{int d\_delete(struct dentry *dentry)}}

Called when the last reference to the \texttt{dentry} object is deleted. It means that
\texttt{d\_count} is zero.

\subsubsection{\texttt{void d\_release(struct dentry *dentry)}}

Called when the \texttt{dentry} object is going to be freed.

\subsubsection{\texttt{void d\_iput(struct dentry *dentry, struct inode *inode)}}

Called before the \texttt{dentry} object is freed. This function is used to notify
the filesystem that the \texttt{inode} object associated with this \texttt{dentry}
object should be freed. If the filesystem doesn't implement this function then the VFS's
\texttt{iput} function is called. It decrements the inode \texttt{i\_count} counter and
if the \texttt{i\_nlink} and \texttt{i\_count} field is zero then the \texttt{inode} is
freed.

\subsection{File Object}
\label{lab:file}
A file object describes how a process interacts with a file it has opened. The file
object is created when the file is opened and consists of a \texttt{struct file}
structure defined in \texttt{include/linux/fs.h}. All opened files within one file
system are linked through \texttt{struct list\_head f\_list} field. The header of this
list is stored in the corresponding super block object. The file object contains a pointer
\texttt{struct dentry *f\_dentry} to the dentry object and a pointer \texttt{struct
vfsmount *f\_vfsmount} to the vfsmount object, which is described in section
\ref{lab:vfsmount}. The main information stored in the file object is the position in the
file, which is kept in the \texttt{loff\_t f\_pos} field. Because inode can be used by
several dentries, which means several files, it is not possible to keep this
information in the inode object. The \texttt{f\_pos} represents the current position in
the file from which the next operation will take place. From other data fields we can
mention the \texttt{unsigned int f\_uid, f\_gid} containing the uid and gid of
the user which opened the file. Pointer to the file operations is stored in the
\texttt{struct file\_operations *f\_op} field and it is a copy of the \texttt{struct
file\_operations *i\_fop} pointer from corresponding inode object. Figure
\ref{fig:vfs_file} shows how processes interact with the VFS through the file
objects. We can see three processes and two of them have the same file opened. Every
process in the Linux kernel is represented by the structure \texttt{struct task\_struct}
defined in \texttt{include/linux/sched.h}. The pointer for the currently running task
in the kernel is stored in the \texttt{current} variable. 

Every process keeps all its opened files in structure \texttt{struct files\_struct
*files} defined in \texttt{include/linux/file.h}. This structure contains the
\texttt{struct file **fd} field, which points to an array of pointers to file objects.
The size of the array is stored in the \texttt{int maxfds} field. Usually,
\texttt{fd} points to the \texttt{struct file *fd\_array[NR\_OPEN\_DEFAULT]} field.
The \texttt{NR\_OPEN\_DEFAULT} defines the default size for the \texttt{fd\_array}. It
expands to the \texttt{BITS\_PER\_LONG}, which is defined differently for every
architecture. For example, for i386 architecture its value is 32. If the file process
opens more than \texttt{NR\_OPEN\_DEFAULT} files, the kernel allocates a new, larger
array of file pointers and stores its address in the \texttt{fd} field and updates the
\texttt{maxfds} field to the new array size. So when the user process opens a file the
VFS creates all required objects and stores a pointer to the file object in the \texttt{fd}
array. As a result the user process receives an index (file descriptor) to the \texttt{fd}
field, where the pointer to the corresponding file is stored. Usually, the first
element (index 0) of the array is associated with the standard input of the process,
the second with standard output and the third with the standard error. Unix processes
use the file descriptor as the main file identifier. When the user process wants to
process some operation on a file, it forwards the file descriptor to the kernel.
The kernel then gets a pointer to the corresponding file object from
\texttt{current->files->fd[fd]}. Notice that, thanks to the \texttt{dup(), dup2()} and
\texttt{fnclt{}} system calls, two file descriptors may refer to the same opened file.
That is, two elements of the array could point to the same file object. As an example
we can mention the shell construct \texttt{2>\&1}, which redirects the standard error
to the standard output.\\

\subsection{Filesystem Type Object}
\label{lab:file_system_type}
Each registered filesystem is represented in the Linux kernel as a filesystem type
object. The filesystem type object is created for each filesystem and keeps its base
information. It is represented by the \texttt{struct file\_system\_type} structure
defined in \texttt{include/linux/fs.h}. Thanks to this structure the Linux kernel knows about
the filesystem. Filesystems can be included directly in the Linux kernel or can be
registered on-the-fly as a Linux kernel module (LKM). All file type objects are inserted
into a simply linked list. The \texttt{file\_systems} variable defined in
\texttt{fs/filesystems.c} points to the first item. Field \texttt{struct
file\_system\_type *next} points to the next item in the list. Filesystem type
contains the name of the filesystem stored in the \texttt{const char *name} field, filesystem
flags are stored in the \texttt{int fs\_flags} field (for example
\texttt{FS\_REQUIRES\_DEV}, which says that the filesystem has to be stored on a
physical disk device). In the \texttt{struct list\_head fs\_supers} field is stored
the head of a list of superblock objects corresponding to mounted filesystems of the
given type. The \texttt{struct super\_block *(*get\_sb)} field keeps a pointer to the
specific filesystem function, which returns the filled super block object. 

We will assume, that we have written a new filesystem. Now we have to somehow tell the kernel about
it. This is done through the \texttt{register\_filesystem()} function defined in
\texttt{fs/filesystems.c}. Firstly a new filesystem type object has to be created and
properly filled. Then the \texttt{register\_filesystem} function is called with the newly
created filesystem type object. The kernel adds our new filesystem to the
\texttt{file\_systems} list. Now when the new filesystem is mounted, the kernel searches
for the filesystem type object corresponding to our new filesystem in the
\texttt{file\_systems} list. The search is based on the filesystem name, which is
forwarded to the kernel as a \texttt{-t} mount option (for example ext2). 

\subsection{Fs\_struct Object}
In Linux, each process has its own current working directory and its own root
directory. This information is stored in a fs\_struct object represented by the
\texttt{struct fs\_struct} structure defined in \texttt{include/linux/fs\_struct.h}.
As mentioned in section \ref{lab:file} each process in the Linux kernel is
represented by the \texttt{struct task\_struct} structure. This structure
contains a
\texttt{fs} pointer to the fs\_struct object for the current task. So the kernel knows
the root and current working directory of each process. In fs\_struct object are among
others stored pointers to the root dentry (\texttt{struct dentry *root}),
the current working directory dentry (\texttt{struct dentry *pwd}), a pointer to the
vfsmount structure for the root directory (\texttt{struct vfsmount *rootmnt})
and a pointer
to the vfsmount structure for the current working directory (\texttt{struct vfsmount
*pwdmnt}). The vfsmount object is described in section \ref{lab:vfsmount}.

\subsection{Vfsmount Object}
\label{lab:vfsmount}
In the Linux kernel it is possible to mount a filesystem over another filesystem's directory
tree. One filesystem can be mounted several times and can be even mounted on its own
directory tree. It is also possible to stack multiple mounts on a single mount point.
In this case only the last mounted filesystem is visible and hides the filesystem,
which was mounted before it. After the top most filesystem is unmounted, then the file
system below it is visible again. The vfsmount object is used to keep information
about mounted filesystem and its relationship with other mounted filesystems. It is
defined by the structure \texttt{struct vfsmount} defined in
\texttt{include/linux/mount.h}. The vfsmount object contains the \texttt{struct
vfsmount *parent} pointer to the parent vfsmount object on which it is mounted and
a list of vfsmount objects (children) mounted on its directory tree. The head of this list
is stored in the \texttt{struct list\_head mnt\_mounts} field and vfsmount objects in this
list are linked through the \texttt{struct list\_head mnt\_child} field. \\

Figure \ref{fig:vfs_struct} shows the base connection between VFS objects, which
were described in the text above.

\section{VFS Caches}
\label{lab:cache}
VFS uses the dentry and inode cache to eliminate accesses to the hard disk. Because dentry and
inode object are allocated and deallocated very often, VFS uses for these
objects the slab
allocator. The slab allocator is based on the Linux buddy system for allocating continuous
pages of dynamic memory. The idea behind the slab allocator is to preallocate several
objects of given type and keep them in slabs. A slab is a series of contiguous
physical pages in which objects are kept. The slab allocator then provides these
preallocated objects. Objects are not deallocated but are returned back to the slab
allocator. So there is no overhead for allocating and deallocating objects of given
type because they are already allocated. Slab allocator is used for small objects which
are used very often.

\subsection{Dentry Cache}
\label{lab:dentry_cache}
The dentry cache consists of n-ary dentry tree and dentry hash table. Both are protected
against concurent acceess by one \texttt{dcache\_lock} spinlock which is defined in
\texttt{fs/dcache.c}. Dentry hash table \texttt{dentry\_unused} is used for lookup
operation which converts filename path to the corresponding dentry object. The address of
the parent dentry object and the hash value of the dentry name are used as a key to the hash table.
Filesystems can invalidate dentry objects in the dentry hash table. Which means that
further lookup operations fail and real lookup operation of specific filesystem is
called. Note that dentry is removed only from the hash table, but it still
exists in the dentry
tree and has the \texttt{DCACHE\_UNHASHED} flag set. In Linux one process may delete file,
but there can be other procceses using it. So a proper dentry object has to exist until
the last reference to the dentry object is removed, but no other process can open it again. 

\subsection{Inode Cache}
\label{lab:inode_cache}
The inode hash table \texttt{inode\_hashtable} is defined in
\texttt{fs/inode.c}. The address
of the supper block and inode number are used as a key to the hash table. Concurent
access to the hash table is protected by the \texttt{inode\_lock} spinlock.

\section{Buffer Cache}
The buffer cache is another cache whose purpose is to reduce slow disk operations. It is
common for all native filesystems. When the buffer is read from disk its data is stored
in the \texttt{buffer\_head} structure. This structure contains, aside from the
buffer data,
some meta information about the buffer. For example if the buffer is dirty and
etc.
When the native filesystem tries to read or write  data from or to the disk, the Linux
kernel first looks for the corresponding buffer in the buffer cache.

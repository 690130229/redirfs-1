\chapter{Redirfs Framework}
Redirfs stands for \textbf{REDIR}ector of \textbf{F}ile\textbf{S}ystem calls. In
chapters \ref{lab:lsm}, \ref{lab:overlay} and \ref{lab:dazuko} were described existing
possibilities of file access control in Linux kernel and their limitations. Among
these limitation belong replacing syscall table, duplication of VFS objects, bad
support for security modules, absent safety unloading of security modules, no
possibility how to specify order in which will be security modules called and so on.
To overcome these limitations, I propose a new solution - the RedirFS Framework.

\section{Redirfs Goals}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Provide general, fast, flexible and open source framework allowing to
		redirect native file system calls in VFS objects.
	\item Should not modify Linux kernel source code. 
	\item Implemented as Linux kernel module.
	\item Independent on Linux kernel version.
	\item Be able to register, unregister and manage several third-party filters
		(other Linux kernel modules).
	\item Provide well defined interface allowing filters to set callback
		functions for selected file system operations.
	\item Allow filters to set pre and post native file system callbacks.
	\item Allow filters to select directory subtrees for which their callback
		functions will be called.
	\item Provide way how to allow filters to exclude selected directory
		subtrees.
	\item Be able on fly to include and exclude directory subtrees and add, remove
		or modify filter's callback function.
	\item Modify only VFS object operations which have to be modified.
	\item Be able to call filters in specific order.
	\item React on return values from filters and be able to interrupt filter call
		chain.
	\item Allow filter to forward data from pre to post callback function. 
	\item Allow filters to attach their private data to selected VFS's
		objects.
	\item Return VFS objects operations to the native file system calls as soon as
		possible.
	\item Avoid as much as possible VFS objects duplication.

\end{itemize}

\section{Redirfs Design}
As you can see in figure \ref{fig:redirfs_role} Redirfs Framework creates new layer
between VFS and native filesystems and has two main functions.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Interact with VFS layer and redirect operations selected by filters over
		specified directory subtrees to the Framework.
	\item Interact with filters and call all of them which are interested in VFS
		event which occurs.
\end{enumerate}

Redirfs Framework provides well defined interface to filters which is in detail
described in section \ref{lab:redirfs_interface}. Filter can ask Redirfs Framework for
following actions.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Register itself to the Redirfs Framework. It is the first thing that
		the filter has to do. As result filter receives from Redirfs Framework
		its handler. Filter has to use this handler in every following
		interaction with Redirfs Framework to identify itself. During
		registration filter has to set its name and priority. From Redirfs
		point of view filter's name is not very important and is used only
		for some statistic or debug information. Several filters can have the same
		name. More important is filter's priority. It is an unique number and
		Redirfs Framework calls filters in order defined by theirs priorities.
		They are called upwardly from lower to higher numbers. Lower number
		means higher priority.

	\item Set or modify pre and post callback filter's functions for selected VFS
		operations.

	\item Remove previously set callback functions.

	\item Set directory subtrees over which the filter's callback functions will
		be called.

	\item Remove previously set directory subtrees. When filter removes directory
		subtree which is part of other subtree previously set by same filter than
		the directory subtree which it about to be removed is excluded from the
		previously set subtree.

	\item Activate itself. Filter is not active by default. It means that filter
		can set callbacks and subtrees, but it doesn't receive any events
		until it is activated.

	\item Deactivate itself. Filter is not removed from Redirfs Framework, but it
		is just not notified about registered VFS events until it is 
		activated again.

	\item Remove itself. This removes complete whole filter (Its callbacks and
		all subtrees).
\end{itemize}

	\caption{The Redirfs role during system calls}
	\label{fig:redirfs_role}
\end{figure}

The whole idea behind Redirfs Framework is to replace selected VFS object operations
by Redirfs operations so that VFS calls Redirfs framework instead of native
filesystem. Redirfs is then able to notify all interested filters that VFS tries to
call native filesystem. Figure \ref{fig:redirfs_role} shows that only operations
selected by filters are redirected to the Redirfs Framework. All other operations go
directly to the native file system and Redirfs Framework doesn't affect them in any
way.

\section{Redirfs Architecture}
\label{lab:redirfs_arch}
Redirfs Framework is formed by several objects which are in detail described in
section \ref{lab:redirfs_data_struct}. Here will be described their purpose.

\subsection{Root Object}
Filters can select for which directory subtrees will be their callback functions
called. Directory subtrees are identified by full directory path. When filter ask
Redirfs Framework for new subtree, it creates root object representing
the requested subtree. Then the filter is attached to this new root object. It is
possible that root object for requested subtree already exists. It can happen when
other filter already selected the same subtree. In this case Redirfs Framework only
attach filter to the existing root object.

Root objects are connect in n-ary tree like dentry objects in VFS. The difference is
that in VFS there is only one main dentry object (dentry object for root directory)
and in Redirfs Framework can be several main root objects. These main root objects are
linked in a list. Whole Redirfs Framework is based on root objects and it is important to
understand how the root objects are connected and how the root objects tree is
modified while new filters and directory subtrees are added. In figures
\ref{fig:redirfs_root1}, \ref{fig:redirfs_root2} and \ref{fig:redirfs_root3} is shown
what happen with root objects tree when three different filters are added.

\begin{figure}[hp]
	\begin{center}
		\input{pic_redirfs_root1.pstex_t}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Example: Redirfs root objects for one filter}
	\label{fig:redirfs_root1}
\end{figure}

In figure \ref{fig:redirfs_root1} only one filter called cryptfs is registered in
the Redirfs Framework and it has selected two directory subtrees. So two new root
objects are created and the cryptfs filter is attached to them.

\begin{figure}[hp]
	\begin{center}
		\input{pic_redirfs_root2.pstex_t}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Example: Redirfs root objects for two filters}
	\label{fig:redirfs_root2}
\end{figure}

In figure \ref{fig:redirfs_root2} is registered second filter called avgflt. This
filter has selected only one directory subtree, but it contains both 
subtrees which were set by cryptflt filter. Root objects are reorganized and the
avgflt filter is attached to the new root object and to all root objects which are under it.
In figure \ref{fig:redirfs_root3} is attached one more filter called compressflt. It
has selected the \texttt{/home/john/data/compress} subtree which belongs under
\texttt{/home/john/data} root object. And again the compressflt is attached to the new
root object and to all root objects which are under it. In this case there are no root
object under it.

\begin{figure}[hp]
	\begin{center}
		\input{pic_redirfs_root3.pstex_t}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Example: Redirfs root objects for three filters}
	\label{fig:redirfs_root3}
\end{figure}

Root objects connection in figures \ref{fig:redirfs_root1}, \ref{fig:redirfs_root2}
and \ref{fig:redirfs_root3} are simplified and also only filter pointers are attached
to the root objects. Detailed information are in section
\ref{lab:redirfs_data_struct}. Note that filters are attached to the root objects in
specific order. It is because some filters have to be called sooner or later then
others. The order is specified by filter's priority.

When filter wants to remove or exclude some previously set directory subtree, the
Redirfs Framework detach it from all corresponding root objects. If it is the last
attached filter then the root object is destroyed.

\subsection{Filter Object}
Each registered filter is in the Redirfs Framework represented by the filter object
which contains all its information. As filter asks Redirfs Framework for inserting and
removing directory subtrees, Redirfs Framework is attaching or detaching Filter object
to or from corresponding root objects.

\subsection{Inode Object}
Redirfs inode object is created for each VFS inode which is in one of the directory
subtrees selected by filters. It is dynamically created and destroyed along with VFS
inode. Note that Redirfs inode is different than VFS inode. It is used to find out
which root object corresponds to the VFS inode. It is very important to find right
root object to the VFS inode object. When the VFS object operations are redirected to
the Redirfs Framework, it is only the VFS inode which can be always obtained. When
we have VFS inode object we also can obtain corresponding Redirfs inode which contains
pointer to the proper root object. Then Redirfs Framework can call all filters
attached to the root object. Of course only those filters which are interested in native
filesystem operation which occurred.

\section{Redirfs Data Structures}
\label{lab:redirfs_data_struct}
In this section are in detail described all data structures used in Redirfs Framework.

\subsection{Root Object}
Root object is represented by structure \texttt{struct redirfs\_root\_t}, defined in
\texttt{root.h}. Each root object is attached in one of several n-ary trees. Number of
these trees and their hierarchy depends on directory subtrees selected by Filters. This was
described in section \ref{lab:redirfs_arch}. All roots of these trees are linked in a list
which header \texttt{redirfs\_root\_list} is defined in \texttt{root.c}. Concurrent
access to the hierarchy of root objects is protected by the
\texttt{redirfs\_root\_list\_lock} spinlock.

\subsubsection{\texttt{struct list\_head attached\_flts}}
Each root object can have attached several filter objects. Pointers to all attached
filter objects are linked in a list whom header is stored in this field. Note that
filters in this list are in specific order which depends on filters priorities.

\subsubsection{\texttt{struct list\_head subroots}}
All root objects which belong directly under other root object are linked in a list
which header is stored in this field. In other words all root's children are linked
in this list.

\subsubsection{\texttt{struct list\_head sibroots}}
Through this field are linked all root objects on the same level (siblings).

\subsubsection{\texttt{struct list\_head remove}}
Through this field are linked all root objects which are going to be removed. List
header \texttt{redirfs\_remove\_root\_list} of this list is defined in
\texttt{root.c}. List is protected by \texttt{redirfs\_remove\_root\_list\_lock} which
is also defined in \texttt{root.c}.

\subsubsection{\texttt{struct list\_head inodes}}
List header of all Redirfs inode objects which belong to the root object. Redirfs inode
object is different then VFS inode object and is used to find out right root object.

\subsubsection{\texttt{struct redirfs\_root\_t *parent}}
Pointer to the parent root object. If root object has no parent then this field is set
to NULL.

\subsubsection{\texttt{struct dentry *dentry}}
Every root object represents one directory subtree which is defined by full directory
path. This field contains pointer to the dentry objects which represents this
directory in VFS.

\subsubsection{\texttt{spinlock\_t lock}}
Is used to protect all data fields in root object against concurrent access.

\subsubsection{\texttt{char *path}}
Directory subtree path which is represented by root object.

\subsubsection{\texttt{atomic\_t flt\_cnt}}
Number of attached filters.

\subsubsection{\texttt{struct redirfs\_operations\_t *fw\_ops}}
Every root object contains pointer to the Redirfs Framework operations. These
operations are common for all root objects and their purpose is to call all Filters
attached to the root.

\subsubsection{\texttt{struct redirfs\_operations\_t new\_ops}}
This field contains pointers to the structures of new operations for all VFS objects
belonging to the directory subtree which is represented by root object.

\subsubsection{\texttt{struct redirfs\_operations\_t orig\_ops}}
This field contains pointers to the structures of original native filesystem
operations originally used by VFS objects. 

\subsubsection{\texttt{struct redirfs\_vfs\_operations\_t vfs\_ops}}
This field contains structures of new VFS operations pointers.

\subsubsection{\texttt{struct redirfs\_operations\_counters\_t new\_ops\_cnts}}
In this field are stored counters for each operation in the \texttt{vfs\_ops} field.
Note that each operation can be used by several filters.

\subsection{Filter Object}
Filter object is represented by structure \texttt{struct redirfs\_flt\_t}, defined in
\texttt{filter.h}. All filter objects are linked in a list which header
\texttt{redirfs\_flt\_list} is defined in \texttt{filter.c}. List is protected against
concurrent access by \texttt{redirfs\_flt\_list\_lock} spinlock.

\subsubsection{\texttt{struct list\_head flt\_list}}
Through this field is filter object linked in filters list.

\subsubsection{\texttt{spinlock\_t lock}}
Is used to protect all data fields in filter object against concurrent access.

\subsubsection{\texttt{char *name}}
Filter's name.

\subsubsection{\texttt{int turn}}
Filter's priority.

\subsubsection{\texttt{unsigned int flags}}
Filter's flags. For now this field is not used and is reserved for future usage.
Here could be stored for example information if the filter wants follow submounts or
shrink dentry cache.

\subsubsection{\texttt{atomic\_t active}}
Contains information whether the filter is active (1 -- active, 0 -- not active).

\subsubsection{\texttt{struct redirfs\_vfs\_operations\_t vfs\_pre\_ops}}
Filter's pre callback functions.

\subsubsection{\texttt{struct redirfs\_vfs\_operations\_t vfs\_post\_ops}}
Filter's post callback functions.

\subsubsection{\texttt{struct redirfs\_operations\_t pre\_ops}}
Pointers to the filter's pre callback functions.

\subsubsection{\texttt{struct redirfs\_operations\_t post\_ops}}
Pointers to the filter's post callback functions.

\subsection{Inode Object}
Inode object is represented by structure \texttt{struct redirfs\_inode\_t}, defined in
\texttt{inode.h}. For Redirfs inode allocation and deallocation is used the Linux
kernel slab allocator. Each Redirfs inode is located in \texttt{redirfs\_ihash} hash
table.

\subsubsection{\texttt{struct hlist\_node inode\_hash}}
All Redirfs inode objects with same hash value are linked in list through this field.

\subsubsection{\texttt{struct list\_head inode\_root}}
Each Redirfs inode object belongs to the one root object. All Redirfs inode objects
which belong to the root are linked through this field.

\subsubsection{\texttt{struct list\_head priv}}
For now this field is not used and is reserved for future usage. Filters will be able
through this field attach their private data to the VFS inode object.

\subsubsection{\texttt{struct redirfs\_root\_t *root}}
Pointer to the root object to which this inode object belongs.

\subsubsection{\texttt{spinlock\_t lock}}
Is used to protect all data fields in filter object against concurrent access.

\subsubsection{\texttt{struct super\_block *sb}}
Pointer to the VFS super block object.

\subsubsection{\texttt{unsigned long ino}}
Inode number of corresponding VFS inode object. This and the previous field is used to
find corresponding Redirfs inode object to the VFS inode object.

\subsection{Operations Object}
Operations object is represented by structure \texttt{struct redirfs\_operations\_t},
defined in \texttt{operations.h}. It contains pointers to the inode and file
operations for regular file and directory. It also contains pointer to the dentry
operations. Moreover it defines for each VFS operation structure array
which is used for more comfortable way how to individually access elements in
structure. Each operations object has to be initialized by \texttt{redirfs\_init\_ops}
or \texttt{redirfs\_init\_orig\_ops} function. These functions properly set all arrays
and pointers in operations object. Which function to use for initialization depends if
operations structures are known or not. The \texttt{redirfs\_init\_ops} function is
used when we know them and \texttt{redirfs\_init\_orig\_ops} otherwise.

\section{Redirfs Implementation}
This section describes implementation of the Redirfs Framework. Redirfs Framework as
it is implemented right now has several limitation because not all planned features
were implemented. Note that Redirfs is well defined and all features which were not
for now implemented can be easily added in the future because Redirfs is ready for
them.

For now redirfs allows to redirect inode, file and dentry operation for regular files
and directories. Filters can register only inode permission function and all submounts
directories are ignored.

\subsection{Replacement of VFS Object Operations}
Linux VFS layer provides API which allows to work with VFS objects. Redirfs Framework
uses this API and connection between VFS objects to replace operations in VFS objects.
Note that operations replacement is done only by assigning new pointer value to the
VFS object.

\subsubsection{Replacement of Existing Dentry and Inode Object Operations}
Dentry objects are in the Linux VFS connected in n-ary tree. VFS provides
\texttt{path\_lookup()} function to convert filename path to the corresponding dentry
object. Redirfs Framework uses this function when filter wants to include or exclude
some directory subtree to find directory dentry object. Now it can goes through dentry
subtree and replace operations in all existing dentry and inode objects. Note that
each dentry has pointer to the corresponding inode. Redirfs provides
\texttt{redirfs\_walk\_dcache()} function which locks dentry and inode cache and goes
through specific dentry subtree. It takes five arguments. Start dentry object,
callback function which is called for every dentry object in the dentry subtree,
callback data for this function, callback function which is called when the mount
point dentry is found and its callback data. Note that to some dentry objects in the
dentry subtree can be already attached other Redirfs root objects. If this is true
then the \texttt{redirfs\_walk\_dcache()} function has to skip those dentries. We can
not change operations for other root objects because they can have attached different
filters and can replace different operations. This function is called only in two cases.
When filter inserts new directory subtree which is not already added and when the last
filter is detached from root object.

Dentry and inode object operations are replaces in \texttt{redirfs\_set\_new\_ops()}
function which is called for every dentry object in dentry subtree by
\texttt{redirfs\_walk\_dcache()} function. This function beside replacing operations
has to save old VFS objects operations. It is important because Redirfs has to set
original operations back when the last filter is detached from the root object. Note that
not all native filesystem operations are known at the beginning. For example if
\texttt{redirfs\_set\_new\_ops()} function gets dentry object of regular file for the
first time it saves original operations to the \texttt{orig\_ops} structure in
corresponding root object.

Function \texttt{redirfs\_set\_orig\_ops()} is called in the same way as
\texttt{redirfs\_set\_new\_ops()} and assigns VFS objects back original operations.
This is very easy because Redirfs knows about all operations which previously
replaced.
 
\subsubsection{Replacement of Existing File Object Operations}
Replacing file object operations is a little bit complicated. File object, when is
created, copies pointer to the file operations from corresponding inode object. So
replacing file operations only in the inode objects is not enough. Problem is that
there is no way how to get file objects related with inode or dentry object. File
object contains pointer to the corresponding dentry object but dentry object does not
contain pointer to the file object. It is logical because dentry object can be used by
several files. But this is the same situation as with inode and dentry objects. Each
inode object can be used by several dentries and in this relation inode object
contains list of all dentry objects which are using it. However this is not true in
relation between dentry and file object and Redirfs has to find other way how to
replace operations in file objects. All file objects created over one filesystem are
linked in a list which header is stored in the super block object. Each dentry object
contains pointer to the super block object. So when Redirfs knows dentry object for
the directory subtree it can go through the list of all file objects and replace their
operation. Other problem is that in this list are linked all file object. It means
that there are file objects which do not belong under specified directory subtree.
Here Redirfs has to compare file names and replace operations only in file objects
which belongs under the directory subtree. Redirfs provides
\texttt{redirfs\_replace\_files\_ops} which locks the files list lock and goes through
all file objects in the list. It takes four arguments. Directory path for which will
be file objects operations replaced, dentry objects representing directory path, new
file operations and file type for which will be the operations replaced. Here again
Redirfs has to take care when the file object does not belong under other root object. 
This is called in same cases as \texttt{redirfs\_walk\_dcache} function and when
original file operations are obtained.

\subsection{Replacement of Newly Created Objects Operations}
This is easier because all operations of VFS objects in caches are already replaced.
Redirfs only need to know which operations are creating new objects. Then let the
native filesystem to create these objects and replace their operations before they
will be returned back to the VFS. Follows functions which create new VFS objects.

\subsubsection{Create operation in directory inode}
This operation creates new regular file in specified directory.

\subsubsection{Lookup operation in directory inode}
This operation is called by VFS if it does not found corresponding dentry object in
path lookup operation. This operation is called for every file type.

\subsubsection{Mkdir operation in directory inode}
This function creates new directory object.\\

This functions can handle only regular files and directories. In future Redirfs will be
able to handle all file types. For example to handle creating of special files like
char devices, fifos or block devices, Redirfs need to implement mknod operation for
directory inodes. There is one more problem because for example each char device has
its own operations. So it is not possible to handle them all in one way like regular
files and directories operations which are same for whole file system. Redirfs
Framework is ready for this.

\subsection{Root Objects Manipulation}
Redirfs provides several functions which operate over root hierarchy. Base function
are \texttt{redirfs\_add\_root{}}, \texttt{redirfs\_remove\_root},
\texttt{find\_root\_parent} and \texttt{redirfs\_find\_root}. 

Most important is \texttt{redirfs\_walk\_roots()}, defined in \texttt{root.c}. This
function goes through all root objects. It takes three arguments. Root object from
which to start, callback function and callback function data. If start root object is
NULL then callback function is called for every root object in root hierarchy. This
function is used for attaching and detaching filter to and from root objects
(\texttt{redirfs\_attach\_flt} and \texttt{redirfs\_detach\_flt}). 

\subsection{Operations}
Each root object contains two sets of operations. First are operations in which are
stored pointers to the native filesystem operations. These operations are
never changed and are used when Redirfs Framework wants to set original operations
back to the VFS objects. These operations are stored in the \texttt{orig\_ops} field
in root object. Note that pointers in \texttt{orig\_ops} field cannot be changed
because any change affects whole native filesystem. Second operations contains copies
of native filesystem operations and are stored in the \texttt{new\_ops} field in
root object. These pointers can be modified because root object has its own copy. 
To all VFS objects which belong to specific root object are changed operations to the
operations stored in \texttt{new\_ops}. At the beginning \texttt{new\_ops} contains
copies of native filesystem operations. Only several function needed directly by Redirfs
Framework like create, mkdir or lookup are redirected.

Redirfs Framework contains global operations \texttt{redirfs\_fw\_ops} defined in
\texttt{redir.c}. When filter wants to register new callback function then
corresponding function pointer in \texttt{new\_ops} is replaced by pointer
from \texttt{redirfs\_fw\_ops}. So only one pointer assignment changes
specific operation for all involved VFS objects. Operation from
\texttt{redirfs\_fw\_ops} calls all filters which are interested in VFS event which
occurs. Each operation in \texttt{new\_ops} has counter. If counter for specific
operation is zero then pointer for this operation in \texttt{new\_ops} is replaced
back to original operation from \texttt{orig\_ops}.

\subsection{Redirfs Inodes Manipulation}
Selected VFS objects operations are redirected to the Redirfs Framework operations.
VFS then calls Redirfs operations instead of native
filesystem operations. Interfaces of native filesystem operations does not know anything
about Redirfs Framework objects. For example, VFS calls permission function which is
redirected to the \texttt{redirfs\_reg\_permission()} function. This function has
three arguments. Inode object, mode, and nameidata structure. So Redirfs Framework has
to introduce some way how to obtain corresponding root object. Root object contains
attached filters which have to be called. For this purpose Redirfs Framework has its
own inodes which contains pointers to the corresponding root objects. VFS inode object
can be somehow obtained in every function. Each VFS inode is unambiguously identified
by super block pointer and inode number. So Redirfs uses these two values as a key
how to find correspond Redirfs inode to the VFS inode. Redirfs inode is created
for each vfs object which has redirected operations.

Note that Redirfs inodes have to stay consistent with VFS inodes. In VFS can exist
dentry object without inodes and inodes without dentry object. For example Linux
kernel can in every time prune dentry cache. For this reason Redirfs Framework
redirect dentry operation \texttt{d\_iput} which is called when dentry object is going
to be removed from dentry cache.

\subsection{Example of Including New Path}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Filter calls \texttt{redifs\_include\_path()} with path argument. 
	\item Function \texttt{redirfs\_find\_root()} tries to find corresponding root
		object in root hierarchy. If the root has been found,  go to 3 else
		go to a.
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item \texttt{redirfs\_alloc\_root()} allocates new root
				object.
			\item \texttt{redirfs\_find\_root\_parent()} tries to find
				parent root for newly created root. If the parent has
				been found, goto i else goto c.
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item \texttt{redirfs\_inherit\_root()} copies
						all operations from parent to the new
						root object.
				\end{enumerate}
			\item \texttt{redirfs\_add\_root()} adds new root to the root
				hierarchy.
			\item \texttt{redirfs\_walk\_dcache()} with \texttt{
				redirfs\_set\_new\_ops()} function redirects all operations of
				VFS objects which belong to the new root.
			\item \texttt{redirfs\_replace\_files\_ops()} replaces
				operations in corresponding file objects.
		\end{enumerate}
	\item \texttt{redirfs\_walk\_roots()} with \texttt{redirfs\_attach\_flt()}
		function attaches filter object to the all corresponding root objects in root
		hierarchy.
\end{enumerate}



\section{Redirfs Interface}
\label{lab:redirfs_interface}
Whole interface to the Redirfs Framework is stored in the \texttt{redirfs.h} header
file. In this section are described all data types and operations provided by Redirfs
Framework to filters.

\subsection{Data types}

\subsubsection{File and Operations group identifiers}
Linux distinguish between seven file types -- regular files, directories, fifos,
sockets, pipes, char devices and block devices. Each file type has its own groups of
operations. For example inode and file operations. When filter wants to register some 
callback function it has to specify to which file type and operation group is the
callback function related. For example \texttt{REDIRFS\_I\_DIR} specifies that the
filter callback function is related to the inode operations group for directory.
All other file types and operation groups identifiers are defined in
\texttt{redirfs.h}.

\subsubsection{Specific Operation identifier}
From previous paragraph we know how to distinguish between file types and operations
groups. Other thing which filter has to specify in callback function registration is
specific operation in operations group. Redirfs Framework defines identifier for each
operation in each operations group. For example \texttt{REDIRFS\_IOP\_MKDIR}
represents mkdir inode operation. So when filter wants to register callback function
it has to specify two identifiers. First is file type and operations group and second
is specific operation. These two identifiers provide way how to unambiguously
identify each VFS operation.

\subsubsection{\texttt{enum redirfs\_retv}}
This enum contains all return values which can be returned from filter callback
function back to the Redirfs Framework. For now it has only two fields.
\texttt{REDIRFS\_RETV\_STOP} tells Redirfs Framework to interrupt calling of subsequent
filters and \texttt{REDIRFS\_RETV\_CONTINUE} allows to call next filter in chain.

\subsubsection{\texttt{typedef void* redirfs\_filter}}
After registration filter receives handler of this type. Filter then has to, in every
further interaction with Redirfs Framework, identify itself with this handler.

\subsubsection{\texttt{typedef void* redirfs\_context}}
This type has for now no functionality. It is reserved for future usage. In future it
will keep operation context data and will allow filter for example to attach its private
data to VFS objects. For now it is used only for filter callback functions interface
entireness.

\subsubsection{\texttt{union redirfs\_op\_args\_t}}
Each native file system call has several arguments. Arguments for each file system
function are grouped into a structure and \texttt{redirfs\_op\_args\_t} contains union
of all these structures. For example all arguments for inode create function are
grouped in \texttt{i\_create} structure. Filter callback function receives pointer to
this union and in proper field will be all arguments for the native filesystem
function.

\subsubsection{\texttt{union redirfs\_op\_retv\_t}}
Contains union of all data types which can be returned from native file system calls.
Filter callback function has to return proper value in specific field so that Redirfs
Framework can return this value to the VFS. This value has to be set only when filter
forbids to call other filters with lower priority.

\subsubsection{\texttt{struct redirfs\_op\_exts\_t}}
Stores extended data which might be useful for some filters. At this moment this
structure is not used and is reserved for future usage.
\begin{list}{}{}
	\item \textbf{DATA FIELDS}
		\begin{list}{}{}
			\item \texttt{const char* fill\_path} -- Full path name of
				accessed inode.
		\end{list}
\end{list}

\subsubsection{\texttt{struct redirfs\_args\_t}}
Contains all information which filter callback function can receive from Redirfs
Framework. It just encapsulates several other structures and provide flexible way for
future extensions without interface modification.  

\begin{list}{}{}
	\item \textbf{DATA FIELDS}
		\begin{list}{}{}
			\item \texttt{union redirfs\_op\_args\_t args} -- Arguments of
				original native file system function.
			\item \texttt{struct redirfs\_op\_exts\_t exts} -- Extended
				information.
			\item \texttt{union redirfs\_op\_retv\_t retv} -- Return value
				of original native filesystem function.
		\end{list}
\end{list}

\subsubsection{\texttt{struct redirfs\_op\_t}}
Is used for filter callback function registration and unregistration. Pre and post
callback functions pointers can be set to NULL. This has different behavior for
registration and unregistration. For registration NULL pointer means that filter
doesn't want to register this function, but for unregistration it means that filter
wants to remove this callback function. For example if filter wants to register only
pre callback function it sets the post callback function pointer the NULL. If
filter wants to remove post callback function, but keeps pre callback function it
has to set the post callback function pointer to the NULL and pre callback
function pointer to some value different from NULL. 

\begin{list}{}{}
	\item \textbf{DATA FIELDS}
		\begin{list}{}{}
			\item \texttt{int type} -- File and operation type identifier. As
				has been written earlier, Linux has seven file types. Here
				has to be specified to which file type callback
				function belong. Please note that every file is in
				Linux represented by several structures and each
				structure has its own operations. So this field
				identifies aside from a file type also operation type.
				All usable values are defined in \texttt{redirfs.h}.
				For example \texttt{REDIRFS\_I\_REG} says that
				callback function will be used for regular file and inode
				operations.
			\item \texttt{int op} -- By \texttt{type} field is selected
				group of operations. This field selects specified
				function in this group. If \texttt{REDIRFS\_I\_REG} value is
				set in \texttt{type} field then \texttt{op} field has to
				contain inode operation identifier. For example
				\texttt{REDIRFS\_IOP\_LOOKUP} value.
			\item \texttt{enum redirfs\_retv (*pre\_op)(redirfs\_context
				context,\\struct redirfs\_args\_t *args)} -- Pre
				callback function pointer.
			\item \texttt{enum redirfs\_retv (*post\_op)(redirfs\_context
				context,\\struct redirfs\_args\_t *args)} -- Post
				callback function pointer.
		\end{list}
\end{list}

\subsubsection{Filter Callback Function Interface}
Each filter callback function has to have following interface \\
\texttt{enum redirfs\_retv func\_name(redirfs\_context context,\\struct redirfs\_args\_t *args)}.

\begin{list}{}{}
	\item \textbf{ARGUMENTS}
		\begin{list}{}{}

				is not used. It is reserved for future usage.
		\end{list}
	\item \textbf{RETURN VALUE}
		\begin{quotation}
			\noindent On success, filter handler is returned. On error,
			negative value is returned. For return value testing has to be
			used Linux kernel functions \texttt{IS\_ERR} and
			\texttt{PTR\_ERR} defined in \texttt{include/linux/err.h}. It
			is because \texttt{redirfs\_filter} type is defined as a void
			pointer and integer error value is returned as a pointer
			value. Kernel uses those functions to return pointer or error
			in the same return value.
		\end{quotation}
	\item \textbf{ERRORS}
		\begin{list}{}{}
			\item \texttt{-EEXIST} -- Other filter with same priority is

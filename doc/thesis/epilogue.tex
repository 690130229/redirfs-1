\chapter{Epilogue}
This thesis describes the problems and limitations of the existing solutions for
filesystem control access. The only solution supported directly by the Linux kernel is
the LSM framework. It was integrated into the Linux kernel 2.6 and it provides a set
of callback functions which can be registered by the security modules. LSM is intended
as a general framework which provides a way to control access to all Linux kernel
structures. It does not enhance Linux kernel security by itself. It just provides an
interface for security modules. LSM has a big problem with the stacking of security
modules. Only one security module can be registered directly to the LSM framework.
Other modules are always registered to the security module which was registered before
it. If the security module is not able to register other modules then no other module
can be used. Modules are called in the order in which they were registered. There is
no way of changing the calling order. With this stacking approach it is also not
possible to safely remove security modules which have registered other security
modules.

Another method of filesystem access control is to use the overlay filesystem. The linux
kernel doesn't provide any special support for overlay filesystems. The whole idea
behind it is that the linux kernel allows the mounting of a filesystem over another
already mounted filesystem. The original filesystem is covered by the new one. Overlay
filesystem uses this feature. When the overlay filesystem is mounted it covers the
original one and links its VFS objects with the VFS objects of the original
filesystem. This means that the overlay filesystem duplicates all VFS objects (file,
inode, dentry) created for the original filesystem. Overlay filesystems can be stacked
and again, as in the LSM, there is no way of specifying the order of overlay
filesystems and how to safely unmount them (overlay filesystem could be used by other
overlay filesystem).

It is also possible to use a general access control framework (RSBAC, Medusa), but
these projects are not integrated into the Linux kernel. This means that the kernel has
to be patched and maintaining patches for different kernel versions is also difficult.
Another special project for filesystem access control is the Dazuko. It is used mainly
by anti--virus companies for on--access scanning. It uses several methods of interaction
with the Linux kernel. For Linux kernels 2.2 and 2.4 it replaces the syscall table.
This is generally not a good idea (rootkit detectors) and syscall function are too
high (NFS kernel daemon). For Linux kernel 2.6 Dazuko uses the LSM framework whose
problems were mentioned above. Moreover, the LSM framework does not provide any way to
catch on close event which is very important for anti--virus applications. As a
solution, Dazuko uses RSBAC framework. At this moment Dazuko maintainer Jogh Ogness
tries to solve all these problems with the overlay filesystem.

I have proposed a completely new framework called Redirfs to overcome all the problems
and limitations mentioned above. It creates a new layer between the Linux VFS and the
native filesystems. It interacts directly with the VFS layer and replaces the VFS
objects operations. It provides a well defined interface for third--party kernel
modules called filters. Each filter can register pre and post callback function for
each native filesystem operation. It can also specify directory sub--trees over which
their callback functions will be called. Filters can even exclude directory sub--trees.
Filters are called in a specific order defined by their priorities. Redirfs modifies
only those VFS object operations for which there are registered Filter callback
functions. This means that all other operations go directly to the native filesystem
with absolutely no overhead. Redirfs also modifies only the VFS objects which have to
by modified. It returns VFS objects operations back to the native filesystem
operations as soon as possible (no filter needs them).

Base parts of the Redirfs framework were implemented. The current implementation has
several limitations. Note that these limitations are not design limitations! Only that
some features have not been implemented yet. The Redirfs framework is well defined and
ready for all intended features. Here are some limitations that will be removed in the
future. At the moment filters can only register callback functions for dentry, inode
and file operations over regular files and directories. All submounted directories are
ignored.

Some parts of the Redirfs framework need to be implemented in a more sophisticated
way. For example, replacement of file objects operations is implemented in a very
unsophisticated way.
Redirfs goes through all of the created file objects and checks if the file object
belongs to the specified directory sub-tree. This check is comparing the full filename
path with the directory path, which is too slow. This and several other implementation
parts should be improved and optimized. This could be work for future projects, as
well as some other user-space tools for filters, the interface for Redirfs in the
/proc filesystem, the Redirfs port to BSD systems, and implementation of several
filters.

The current implementation was tested on Linux kernels 2.6.10 and 2.6.11.3 and several
filters were written for testing, including avgflt. Redirfs works without problems on
uniprocessor systems without preemptive kernel. On SMP systems and preemptive kernels
there is a problem with correct locking. This will be fixed.

Redirfs, with the help of GRISOFT, s.r.o, will continue as an open source project.
